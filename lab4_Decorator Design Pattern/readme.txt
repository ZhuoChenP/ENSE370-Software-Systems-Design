In Lab4, I add six weapons for the knight, Bazooka has AttackDamage of 25,
Bow has AttackDamage of 5,
Dagger has AttackDamage of 8,
Pistol has AttackDamage of 15,
Rifle has AttackDamage of 20,
Sword has AttackDamage of 10.
Each decorator class weapon will print proper AttackDescription and accumulate the AttackDamage.
The basic class/knight is concrete class, in this case, the class name is Knight which provides the basic information for the knight,
in other term, it is a "naked" knight without any weapon equiped.
